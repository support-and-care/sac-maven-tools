# NAME
#     gh-subscribe - Subscribe to notifications for GitHub repositories.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     ./gh-subscribe
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     This script retrieves a list of remote GitHub repositories associated with the current Git project
#     and automatically subscribes to notifications for these repositories using the GitHub API.
#
# REQUIREMENTS
#     - The script requires a valid GitHub token to be set in the environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN.
#     - curl utility is required for API requests.
#
# USAGE
#     To run this script, navigate to a Git repository and execute:
#         ./gh-subscribe
#
#     Ensure that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is exported with a valid personal access token
#     before running this script.
#
# EXAMPLES
#     $ export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
#     $ ./gh-subscribe
#
# NOTES
#     - The script subscribes you to all repositories listed in your Git remotes.
#     - Existing subscription settings will be updated to ensure notifications are enabled
#       and ignored topics are turned off.
