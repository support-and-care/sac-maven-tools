# This script executes Maven goals for multiple projects with specific options and configurations.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   run-maven [Maven goals...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   This script automates the execution of Maven goals for a list of projects defined
#   in an environment variable `PROJECTS`. It ensures that Maven uses a specific local
#   repository directory and applies provided goals across all projects sequentially.
#
#   The script reads common functions from the `common-functions.sh` file located in the
#   same directory as the script itself.
#
# USAGE EXAMPLE
#   run-maven clean install
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#   PROJECTS   A space-separated list of project paths or identifiers for which Maven
#              goals will be executed.
#          Default: All projects listed in .repo/project.list
#
# NOTES
#   - The script requires the sourced `common-functions.sh` file to define the `exec_mvn`
#     function, which handles the Maven execution logic.
#   - The script uses the `root` variable (set in common-functions.sh) to define the local
#     Maven repository directory.
#   - The script uses the `opts` variable to define additional Maven options, such as the
#     local repository directory.
